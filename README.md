# Email-Forwarder
Do you have a domain you're managing through AWS? Would you like to use that domain for emails, but you're too cheap to pay the $4.00 a month per user for WorkMail? Then I may have the product for you.
This project aims to forward emails sent to your domain to an address of your choosing.

### Features
 * *Multiple Mappings:* Maybe you'd like to forward emails for more than yourself. With multiple email mappings, you can forward emails for the entire family!
 * *Unmapped Emails Bounced*: Emails sent to your domain that aren't mapped get bounced back to the sender!
 * *Original Message Headers:* You need to know who sent the orginal email? You need to who the address the email was sent to? No need to worry, the orginal header info is added to the body of the email.
 * *Supports Large Attachments:* Large or small, you'll get your attachments!
